    <p class="card-text text-justify">Due to COVID-19, Tax Analysts will host our 50th Anniversary celebration in early 2021. During this virtual event, we will commemorate the history, growth, and achievements of Tax Analysts, and we will look towards our next 50 years. We also will
        honor Larry Gibbs â€“ a former IRS commissioner and Tax Analysts board member, now a senior counsel at Miller & Chevalier, and a longstanding pillar of the tax community. As part of our 50th Anniversary, Tax Analysts launched Taxing Issues, a webinar
        series though which we have brought the tax community together with key policymakers to discuss leading issues of tax policy and administration. It has been incredibly well-received and will continue next year. Below are sponsorship opportunities
        for our partners to support this work and to provide a forum for the debate on tax policy.</p>
